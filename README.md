To see a full guide on how to use these configuration, please visit [install](https://dots.sagoez.com) page.

**Recommended [linux]**: If you're using i3 I highly recommend using [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) and/or [xfce4-appfinder](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-appfinder) for apps and [pavucontrol](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) for sound, since getting used to app names can be a bit hard at the beginning.
